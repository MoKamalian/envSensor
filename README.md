# Environmental Sensors



## Purpose: 

The purpose of this project was to establish sensor nodes that would collect environmental data such as tempurature, pressure, humidity etc.  The data is then send to a cloud service via a Raspberry Pi.  The environmental data is then displayed onto a dashboard for viewing.

## Materials used: 
1. Arduino MKR ENV 1300 series
	- Arduino MKR ENV Shield 
	- Dipole Antenna for Arduino
2. Arduino Uno series
	- Dragino Lora shield v95 (915MHz for North America) 
3. Raspberry Pi with Raspberry Pi OS installed
